üö® THE #CIPCCHALLENGE IS HERE! üö®

I'm about to show you something that will BLOW YOUR MIND...

*[Show phone with WhatsApp open]*

This is how long it takes to check if your business is CIPC compliant:

*[Start timer, type "SCORE 2020123456789"]*

90 seconds later...

*[Show compliance score result]*

BOOM! üí• 

Your compliance score, all issues found, and instant quotes to fix everything.

But here's the CRAZY part...

*[Show payment screen]*

R99 to fix beneficial ownership that could cost you R50,000 in penalties!

*[Show before/after: 6 hours of paperwork vs 90 seconds]*

The old way: 6 hours, queues, stress, mistakes
The new way: 90 seconds, done from your couch

WHO ELSE IS TIRED OF WASTING TIME ON CIPC?
