# 🚀 CIPC Agent Platform

**AI-Powered CIPC Compliance Automation for South African SMMEs**

A comprehensive AI-driven platform designed to streamline and automate CIPC (Companies and Intellectual Property Commission) compliance workflows for South African Small, Medium, and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs).

## 🎯 Overview

The CIPC Agent Platform provides a user-friendly interface and a robust backend to manage various CIPC compliance tasks, from beneficial ownership declarations to general company compliance.

### Key Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Agents**: Specialized services for different compliance tasks (e.g., KYC, Form Generation, Regulation Monitoring).
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboard**: Centralized view for managing compliance status, tasks, and notifications.
- 📝 **Beneficial Ownership Form**: Streamlined process for declaring beneficial ownership.
- 📱 **Responsive UI**: Modern and intuitive user interface built with React and Shadcn UI.
- 🔒 **Secure & Compliant**: Designed with security and data privacy in mind.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The CIPC Agent Platform follows a client-server architecture:

- **Client**: A React-based frontend application providing the user interface.
- **Server**: A Node.js/TypeScript backend handling API requests, business logic, and interactions with external services.
- **Shared**: Contains common types, interfaces, and schemas used by both client and server.
- **Agents (Server Services)**: Modular services within the server responsible for specific AI-driven tasks, similar to the "Agent Army" concept.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend (Client)
- **Framework**: React
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- **Build Tool**: Vite

### Backend (Server)
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **API Framework**: (Likely Express.js or similar, to be confirmed)
- **AI/Agent Orchestration**: Custom implementation leveraging AI services.

### Shared
- **Schema Definition**: TypeScript interfaces and Drizzle schema.

## 🚀 Quick Start

To get the CIPC Agent Platform up and running locally:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or Yarn
- Docker and Docker Compose (for database and other services, if applicable)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd CIPC-Agent
    ```

2.  **Install Client Dependencies**
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install # or yarn install
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Install Server Dependencies**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install # or yarn install
    cd ..
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection strings, API keys). A `.env.example` might be provided for guidance.

5.  **Database Setup**
    (Instructions for setting up and migrating the database will go here, e.g., using Drizzle Migrate)

6.  **Start the Applications**
    ```bash
    # Start the client
    cd client
    npm run dev # or yarn dev
    
    # In a new terminal, start the server
    cd server
    npm run dev # or yarn dev
    ```

7.  **Access the Application**
    - Client: Typically http://localhost:5173 (or as configured by Vite)
    - Server API: Typically http://localhost:3000 (or as configured by the server)
